              This guide assumes that you are familiar with coinevo-wallet-cli, and just need help connecting it to your wallet extension.
              If you are brand new to Coinevo and coinevo-wallet-cli, we recommend reading a guide to using coinevo-wallet-cli on <a target="_blank" href="https://getcoinevo.org/knowledge-base/user-guides/simplewallet">getcoinevo.org</a>.
            </p>

          <h4 class="left">Initialize a new wallet if not done already</h4>
          <p class="left">
            To run coinevo-wallet-cli in rpc mode, you first need to have an initialized and synced wallet.
            If you do not have this yet, please do so now.
          </p>

          <div class="dyk-box">
            <p class="left">
              <span class="bold">Did you know?</span> It is possible to use Coinevo's coinevo-wallet-cli as a "lightweight" wallet, connected to a remote node.
              For example, if you wanted to connect to coinevoclub.com's public node, you can add the following flag when opening coinevo-wallet-cli:
            </p>
            <p class="terminal">
              coinevo-wallet-cli.exe --daemon-address mobile3.coinevo.tech:33330
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4 class="left">Running a wallet in rpc mode</h4>
          <p class="left">
            To use this extension, you must launch coinevo-wallet-cli in rpc mode.
            This requires that you use an extra three flags as part of your launch script, <span class="mono">--rpc-bind-ip</span>, <span class="mono">--rpc-bind-port</span>, and <span class="mono">--user-agent</span>.
            Typically, you want to bind to your localhost IP, 127.0.0.1, and to port 33332. Your user agent should be a random string of characters and numbers - this acts to authenticate RPC requests to coinevo-wallet-cli. For example:
          <p>
          <p class="terminal">
            coinevo-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file &lt;wallet name&gt; --password &lt;wallet password&gt; --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --rpc-bind-port 33332 --user-agent &lt;some random string&gt;
          </p>
          <p class="left">
            For coinevo-wallet-cli to connect to your extension, you will need to tell the extension which port to listen on.
            If you used port 33332, you are ready to go. If not, open the extension's <a target="_blank" href="/data/html/options.html">Settings page</a> and set the correct port.
            Each time you open the extension, you will be asked to authenticate yourself with your chosen User Agent.
          </p>
          <p class="left">
            After starting coinevo-wallet-cli in rpc mode, check your chrome extension to see if it can connect.
            Click the extension icon in the upper right of your browser to open the extension popup and log in with your User Agent.
            It may take a few seconds for your extension to fully connect to coinevo-wallet-cli.
          </p>
          <div class="dyk-box">
            <p class="left">
              <span class="bold">Note:</span>
              When using rpc mode, coinevo-wallet-cli will not respond to terminal commands because interactive mode is disabled.
              In addition, you cannot close the terminal without closing coinevo-wallet-cli.<br>
              Instead, we recommend minimizing the command prompt.

          <h4 class="left"> Installation and Setup </h4>
          <p class="left">
            To make launching coinevo-wallet-cli as simple and straightforward as possible, we have created an easy-to-use launcher script for coinevo-wallet-cli.
            Follow these steps to get your script setup:
          </p>
          <ul class="setup-steps">
            <li> Open the <span class="bold">Finder</span> and navigate to <span class="italics">Applications</span>. </li>
            <li> Make a new folder in <span class="italics">Applications</span> named "CoinevoWallet". <br>
                 Note: it is important that you do not use a different folder name, as our script requires that things are installed exactly in this location. </li>
            <li> Download the official Coinevo binaries from <a target="_blank" href="https://getcoinevo.org/downloads/">getcoinevo.org</a> for OS X. <br>
                 Unzip the downloaded folder and copy the "coinevo-wallet-cli" program into your new "CoinevoWallet" directory. </li>
            <li> Download "Launch-Script-macOS.zip" from the latest release on our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/coinevo/coinevo-wallet-chrome/releases">GitHub page</a>. <br>
                 Unzip and copy the downloaded script "CoinevoWallet.command" into your "CoinevoWallet" folder. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="left">
            If you have followed the steps above correctly, you are almost ready to make a new wallet to use with the Coinevo Wallet extension.
            However, let's first talk about the difference between connecting your wallet to your own Coinevo node and to a remote node.
          </p>
          <div class="note-box">
            <p class="left">
              <span class="bold">Before Continuing:</span><br>
              Our launcher script gives the option to connect your wallet to a "remote node", hosted by a member of the Coinevo community over the internet.
              It is safe to use such nodes from a security standpoint; node operators do not and cannot know your wallet's secret keys.
              However, using a remote node does lose some privacy, as the remote node operator can see some of your activity that would normally be hidden.
              If you want full privacy, you should run your own Coinevo node.
              Running your own node is not covered here, but help is available on <a target="_blank" href="https://getcoinevo.org/getting-started/running">getcoinevo.org</a>.
            </p>
          </div>


          <h4 class="left"> Setting up a new wallet </h4>
          <p class="left">
            The first thing the launcher script does is help set up a new wallet with coinevo-wallet-cli.
            This has to be done via the command line, but we have tried to make this setup as easy as possible.
            After this initial setup, you should not need the command line wallet again.
          </p>
          <ul class="setup-steps">
            <li> Double-click "CoinevoWallet.command". <br>
                 The script will launch in a new Terminal window and display a message.
                 Follow the dialog, choosing a password and other options. <br>
                 Unless you have your own Coinevo node running or want to specify a specific node, choose the "remote" option when prompted. </li>
            <li> Once you have chosen all of your settings, coinevo-wallet-cli will generate a new wallet for you and tell you a secret 25 word "seed".
                 Write down your seed and keep it safe and private. This seed is all you ever need to restore a corrupt or lost wallet. </li>
            <li> coinevo-wallet-cli should have told you to type "refresh" to get your wallet going. Do that now. <br>
                 Your wallet will begin to scan Coinevo's blockchain to bring it up to date. This will take some time. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="left">
            Once it is done refreshing, coinevo-wallet-cli will tell you it is up to date and display a balance.
            Close the wallet by typing "exit".
          </p>


          <h4 class="left"> Connecting your extension to coinevo-wallet-cli </h4>
          <p class="left">
            Now that you have created a new wallet, the launcher script will work slightly differently.
            Instead of opening coinevo-wallet-cli in the command line, the script will launch coinevo-wallet-cli in the background on your computer.
            This allows your wallet extension to talk with coinevo-wallet-cli and send and receive transactions.
            Any time you want to use your wallet, the script will need to be running.
          </p>
          <ul class="setup-steps">
            <li>
              To run the script, double-click the "CoinevoWallet.command" file again. <br>
              This time, the script will ask you to enter the password you chose before and pick a node.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition, it will ask you to pick a User Agent.
              Your user agent should be a random string of characters and numbers - this acts to authenticate RPC requests to coinevo-wallet-cli.
              You can pick a new User Agent each time you open coinevo-wallet-cli, or use the same one.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then it will launch coinevo-wallet-cli in rpc mode, and give you some feedback. <br>
              Once finished, you can safely exit the script by typing "exit" or hitting the "x" button in the top left.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now check your chrome extension to see if it is connected online! <br>
              Click the extension icon in the upper right of your browser to open the extension popup and log in with your User Agent.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="left">
            You can turn off your wallet from the extension by clicking "Stop Wallet" in the extension's menu.
            If you do this, you will need to re-launch the script to use the extension again later.

              This guide assumes that you are familiar with coinevo-wallet-cli, and just need help connecting it to your wallet extension.
              If you are brand new to Coinevo and coinevo-wallet-cli, we recommend using our <span id="launcher-script-refer">custom launcher script</span>.
              Otherwise, you can find a guide to using coinevo-wallet-cli on <a target="_blank" href="https://getcoinevo.org/knowledge-base/user-guides/simplewallet">getcoinevo.org</a>.

          <p class="left">
            To run coinevo-wallet-cli in rpc mode, you first need to have an initialized and synced wallet.
            If you do not have this yet, please do so now.
          </p>

              <span class="bold">Did you know?</span> It is possible to use Coinevo's coinevo-wallet-cli as a "lightweight" wallet, connected to a remote node.
              For example, if you wanted to connect to coinevoclub.com's public node, you can add the following flag when opening coinevo-wallet-cli:
            </p>
            <p class="terminal">
              ./coinevo-wallet-cli --daemon-address mobile3.coinevo.tech:33330
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4 class="left">Running a wallet in rpc mode</h4>
          <p class="left">
            To use this extension, you must launch coinevo-wallet-cli in rpc mode.
            This requires that you use an extra three flags as part of your launch script, <span class="mono">--rpc-bind-ip</span>, <span class="mono">--rpc-bind-port</span>, and <span class="mono">--user-agent</span>.
            Typically, you want to bind to your localhost IP, 127.0.0.1, and to port 33332. Your user agent should be a random string of characters and numbers - this acts to authenticate RPC requests to coinevo-wallet-cli. For Example:
          <p>
          <p class="terminal">
            ./coinevo-wallet-cli --wallet-file &lt;wallet name&gt; --password &lt;wallet password&gt; --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --rpc-bind-port 33332 --user-agent &lt;some random string&gt;
          </p>
          <p class="left">
            For coinevo-wallet-cli to connect to your extension, you will need to tell the extension which port to listen on.
            If you used port 33332, you are ready to go. If not, open the extension's <a target="_blank" href="/data/html/options.html">Settings page</a> and set the correct port.
          </p>
          <p class="left">
            After starting coinevo-wallet-cli in rpc mode, check your chrome extension to see if it can connect.
            Click the extension icon in the upper right of your browser to open the extension popup and log in with your User Agent.
            It may take a few seconds for your extension to fully connect to coinevo-wallet-cli.
          </p>
          <div class="dyk-box">
            <p class="left">
              <span class="bold">Note:</span>
              When using rpc mode, coinevo-wallet-cli will not respond to terminal commands because interactive mode is disabled.
              In addition, you cannot close the terminal without closing coinevo-wallet-cli.<br>
              If you want to be able to close the wallet, we recommend using the "screen" command. For example:
            </p>
            <p class="terminal">
              screen ./coinevo-wallet-cli --wallet-file CoinevoWallet.bin --password xxxx --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --rpc-bind-port 33332 --user-agent randomstring
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              If you have never used screen, a quick online search such as "screen command osx" should return plenty of information on how to use it.
