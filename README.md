## Installation and Use

*Coinevo Wallet for Chrome* can be easily installed from the Chrome store (See Above).
If you do not want to install this extension from the Chrome Store, you can
[install from Github](#install-from-github).

This extension is not a full wallet, but rather is an interface to Coinevo's official command
line wallet. As such, it is important to note that this wallet does not store any sensitive
information about your wallet (view key, seed, etc), though you can use this wallet to view
these pieces of information.

For the extension to work, you need to have an instance of coinevo-wallet-cli running in "RPC Mode"
on the same computer as your browser. To learn how to install and start coinevo-wallet-cli, check
[Getting Started with coinevo-wallet-cli](https://github.com/coinevo/coinevo-wallet-chrome/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md).

For this extension to most easily work, your wallet will need to be open 24/7. For this
reason, it is recommended that you treat the wallet as you would your physical wallet. In
other words, do not store your life savings in this wallet, but only that coinevo you might
use day-to-day.
